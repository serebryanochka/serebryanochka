### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Katya, I'm a QA engineer!

My previous experience is not related to testing (worked as an economist, then a holiday organizer - quite successfully in both directions). 
But later I realized that I have desire and motivation to learn something new.
In everyday life, when I used different programs (an online store, an ad site, banking applications), 
I noticed that the sites have errors, shortcomings, an inconvenient interface, and unfinished functionality. 
This outraged me and even annoyed me: why can't it be made convenient and understandable for the user? 
So I decided that I could do my bit and make life easier for users! Now I am in the process of learning software testing. 
I  would like to be useful and plan to develop and grow in this direction.
